# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Rhyloo and if you are here you... you want to see my work, so let's go! Look whatever you want. If you have an idea on which I can collaborate, contact me, rhyloo. [rhyloo](mailto:rhyloot@gmail.com). 

I'm currently studying Electronics, Robotics, and Mechatronics at the University of Malaga, so my time and soul are sold, but it's not a problem because I have some time to work on my personal projects, as you can see.

LaTeX is one of my favorite languages, I think it's because of the high-quality typography of the documents, but I'm not sure. ðŸ˜‰ Another one is MATLAB, it's not exactly a programming language but for my work, it's so useful. About Python, I have done many things with it, a course in freeCodeCamp, bots in Telegram, some small tools for Inkscape, image processing, it is so easy.

My next step is to use more C++ and VHDL because I like embedded systems, so it's necessary for me to learn them and integrate them into different platforms.

I have my Emacs config file, too. Maybe I should add my electrical experiments with SPICE, kiCAD, ORCAD, or LTSpice. Someday.

That's all folks. Have nice _stalking_.
